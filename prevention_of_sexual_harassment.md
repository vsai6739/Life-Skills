# Sexual Harassment at Workplace

## What Comes Under Sexual Harassment?

It is essential that every individual, as well as the organization, be aware of the behavior that is considered sexual harassment. It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure that all employees are aware of what constitutes sexual harassment, the rules to be followed, and the process of redress. Experiencing sexual harassment brings mental agony to the woman subjected to it.

Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behavior (whether directly or by implication) as:

- Physical contact and advances.
- A demand or request for sexual favors.
- Sexually colored remarks.
- Showing pornography or any other unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature.

## Employee Awareness

Many times, not only the employer but also the employee, whether male or female, are unaware of what constitutes sexual harassment and that action can be taken against the offender. In 2015, the Government of India Ministry of Women and Child Development published a “Handbook on Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace.” The purpose was to provide employers with a basic understanding of sexual harassment at the workplace.

It emphasizes that it is obligatory for every employer to provide a safe working environment for female employees. Employers are responsible for restraining, stopping, and providing remedial measures for such issues.

## Punishment for Sexual Harassment

There must be rules for addressing wrongdoing by a person. If, after completing the inquiry by the committees, the allegation against the respondent is proven, they must recommend to the employer:

- Action including a warning to terminate.
- Deduction of an amount from the salary or wages of the respondent to be paid to the complainant or her legal heirs.
- If no service rules are drafted for the organization, punishment may consist of disciplinary action such as a written apology, reprimand, warning, censure, withholding promotion, pay raise, or increment, termination, counseling, or community service.

While there is always a possibility of false complaints, the Act includes provisions for penalties for false or malicious complaints and false evidence. If the committee’s investigation reveals that the accusations are untrue or malicious or if the complainant has provided deceptive documents, action may be taken against the complainant in accordance with service rules.

## Steps Forward

The important recommendations are as follows:

1. **Wider Definition of Rape**  
   The committee has recommended viewing rape and sexual assault not merely as crimes but as expressions of power. Any non-consensual penetration of a sexual nature should be included in the definition of rape.

2. **Replacement of ICC with Tribunal**  
   The committee recommends establishing a tribunal instead of an ICC, as dealing with such complaints internally could discourage women from complaining.

3. **Inclusion of Excluded Women**  
   The POSH Act should be amended to include women in armed forces and agriculture, ensuring their grievances can be redressed. The Act should focus on being gender-neutral.

4. **Punishment of Companies for Non-Compliance**  
   The government should identify and penalize companies that have not formed an ICC or that victimize women. Financial penalties or public naming and shaming could ensure compliance.

5. **Creation of Gender Equity Company Index**  
   The government should aim to create a Gender Equity Company Index, similar to the LGBT+ workplace equality index, to foster gender-sensitive competition among companies.

6. **Raising Awareness**  
   The government needs to raise awareness about gender-sensitive child-rearing practices and introduce a gender-equity syllabus at the school level.

## Conclusion

Creating a safe and respectful workplace is crucial for ensuring the well-being and dignity of all employees, particularly women. By understanding and addressing sexual harassment, organizations can foster a positive environment that encourages productivity and equality. It is essential for both employers and employees to be proactive in their efforts to prevent and address harassment, thereby building a culture of respect and inclusivity.
