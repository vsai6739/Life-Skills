# Tiny Habits
##  In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Interesting idea for me from this video is to achieve goals, you need to focus on the small steps, not the goal itself.
Small steps are clearly defined actions. 

## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

### How to Use MAP

- **Increase Motivation:** Create rewards, make the behavior enjoyable, or connect it to a meaningful goal.
- **Increase Ability:** Simplify the behavior, reduce friction, and make it easier to perform.
- **Introduce Effective Prompts:** Use reminders or signals at the right moment when we are likely to take action.
### What is MAP
**Motivation** (M)

  This is the drive or desire to perform the behavior. Motivation can come from various sources, such as wanting to
  achieve a goal, avoid pain, or gain pleasure.
  It is influenced by emotional drivers, like hope, fear, social acceptance, or curiosity.

**Ability** (A)

  Ability refers to how easy or difficult it is to perform the behavior. Even if someone is highly motivated,
  they may not engage in the behavior if it feels too hard.
  BJ Fogg uses the concept of simplicity here. If you make the action simple enough, people are more likely to do it.

**Prompt** (P)

  The prompt (also called a trigger) is what initiates the behavior. It reminds or signals the person to take action.
  Prompts can be external (notifications, reminders) or internal (a thought or feeling).
  
## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
- When you celebrate after completing a habit, youâ€™re giving your brain a signal that this action was positive and rewarding.
  This creates a feeling of success, which releases dopamine, a chemical in the brain that makes you feel good.
- Celebrating even small wins builds emotional motivation. It turns a challenging task into something that feels good.
  This is crucial, when starting new habits, because motivation can fluctuate. By creating an emotional connection to the habit,
  you give yourself an extra push, even when motivation is low.
- It helps you recognize that you are making progress.
## Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)-1% Better Every Day Video?
The principle of "aggregate marginal gains" highlights the importance of consistently making small improvements, even as little as 1%, as they can significantly impact our success in the long run. These minor improvements may seem trivial, but they accumulate over time, resulting in notable progress and achievements.

For example, if you aim to improve your productivity by 1% each day, it may not seem like much at first, but over the course of a year, that would translate into an overall productivity increase of over 365%. This illustrates the compounding effect of making small improvements consistently.

## Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?
Atomic habits are small habits that are easy to do and can have a big impact on our lives over time. Bad habits stick around not because we don't want to change, but because we don't have the right plan to change. Making small changes can lead to big results, as long as we stick with them for a long time.

## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?
* **Create a Habit Scorecard:** To become more aware of your current habits, make a list of them on a scorecard. This will help you identify patterns and make it easier to track your progress as you work on changing or adding new habits.

* **Use Temptation Bundling:** To make a habit more appealing, pair it with a desirable action. For example, if you love listening to podcasts, only allow yourself to listen while you go for a walk or exercise. This will create a positive association between the habit and a pleasurable activity.

* **Reduce the Steps:** To make a habit easier to maintain, minimize the number of steps required to perform the habit. For example, if your goal is to read more, keep a book on your bedside table so it's easy to pick up and read a few pages before going to sleep.

* **Be Patient and Kind to Yourself:** Building a new habit takes time, so be patient with yourself and don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Instead, focus on getting back on track and celebrating your progress along the way.

##  Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?
Engaging in bad habits such as nail biting, procrastination, smoking, or excessive screen time can negatively impact our productivity and lead to feelings of disappointment and distress. Ultimately, these habits can do more harm than good and may require concerted effort and discipline to overcome.

## Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
One effective approach to developing new habits is to leverage your existing routines and activities. By using habit stacking, you can link new habits to tasks you already perform on a regular basis. For instance, you could opt to practice a minute of meditation after brewing your morning cup of coffee.

## Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
Many of us fall into the trap of forming bad habits because they offer an easy and convenient way to cope with stress or boredom. However, breaking these habits requires us to make them more difficult to maintain.

By introducing additional steps or increasing the difficulty level, we can reduce the appeal of bad habits, ultimately making them less attractive. On the other hand, making good habits more accessible and appealing while removing any obstacles that may impede our progress can help us develop and maintain healthy habits.
