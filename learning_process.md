# Learning Process

## What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
It is a technique where we teach a concept in simple, understandable words, and we can explain it to others so that they can understand properly.

## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The idea I found interesting is when we don't have knowledge about a particular thing, we should go and ask our seniors or top professors. They will surely give some insights that will help us.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- **Active mode** - Active mode is a mode where we are focusing on a problem and we are able to solve that problem without getting distracted. So, if we are in active mode, then we should always try to learn new things.
- **Diffused mode** - Diffuse mode is when our mind is relaxed and free to think, like when we are going for a walk, we think about something.

## According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- Decide what you want to do with that skill after learning.
- Select the parts of the skill that help you and start practicing.
- By practicing the most important things first, we will be able to improve our performance.
- Avoid the things that distract you while learning.
- Practice at least 20 hours.
- Consistency is the key.

## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- Make use of both focused and diffused modes.
- Find joy in learning: Rather than just trying to memorize information for exams or to get through some interviews, try to enjoy the learning process.
- Make larger projects into smaller and manageable steps.
- Take short breaks to refresh your brain and improve focus.
- Develop a growth mindset: Believe that your abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication.
- Regularly practice using the information, whether through problems, examples, or projects to retain it over time.
